# JoJo - CycleGAN

### This is a CycleGAN trained on colorings of my favorite Manga artist Araki Hirohiko, and applying it to new issues of JoJoâ€™s Bizarre Adventure Part 9 - JoJoLands as they come out. Manga colorings often do not come out for years, so this would be huge for getting the full JoJo experience at release.

#### Current Books in Training:
* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4 - Diamond is Unbreakable
* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5 - Vento Aureo
* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6 - Stone Ocean
* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 7 - Steel Ball Run
* JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 8 - JoJolion

#####  Pages are sourced from public colorings available on https://mangadex.org/
