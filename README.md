# JoJo - CycleGAN

#### This is a CycleGAN trained on colorings of my favorite Mangaka, Araki Hirohiko, and applying it to new issues of JoJoâ€™s Bizarre Adventure Part 9 - JoJoLands as they come out. Manga colorings often do not come out for years, so this would be huge for getting the full JoJo experience at release.
